1) Strategy Pattern
for each class C:
  if C has multiple methods with similar structure but different implementations:
      if C does not use interfaces or abstract classes to define these behaviors:
          report "Class " + C.name + " may benefit from Strategy Pattern to encapsulate varying behaviors."


2) Code Duplication
for each pair of methods (M1, M2) in the codebase:
  if similarity(M1, M2) > THRESHOLD:
      report "Methods " + M1.name + " and " + M2.name + " have high code duplication."


3) Unused Variables
for variable in each class:
    if variable is not used in any method or constructor:
        report "Unused variable: " + variable.name + " in class " + class.name


4) Data Type Compatibility
for variable in each method:
    if variable.type is incompatible with assigned value:
        report "Data type incompatibility for variable: " + variable.name + " in method " + method.name
